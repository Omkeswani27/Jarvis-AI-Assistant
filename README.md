# Jarvis AI Assistant  

A smart AI-powered virtual assistant inspired by J.A.R.V.I.S. It uses the `mistralai/Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407` API for language understanding, along with NLP, speech recognition, and automation to handle queries, control system functions, and fetch real-time data.  

## Features  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for intelligent conversations.  
- **Speech Recognition** to take voice commands.  
- **System Control** (e.g., open apps, control volume, etc.).  
- **Real-time Information Fetching** (e.g., weather, news, stock prices).  
- **Task Automation** to boost productivity.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x  
- **APIs**:  
  - `mistralai/Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407` for language understanding  
- **Libraries**:
